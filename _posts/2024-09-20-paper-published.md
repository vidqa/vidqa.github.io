On September 20, 2024, our paper "Question Generation Capabilities of Small Large Language Models" was published at NLDB 2024. 
In this work, we examine how fine-tuned text-based transformers can support automatic question generation for educational purposes. 
We compare different model architectures, analyze the impact of various token search strategies, and introduce a manual evaluation metric to assess naturalness and suitability of generated questions. 

Our results highlight how transformer architectures influence the structure and quality of generated questions, while search strategies play only a minor role.
