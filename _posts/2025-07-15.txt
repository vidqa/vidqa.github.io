On July 15, 2025, our paper "Enhancing the Learning Experience Using Vision-Language Models to Generate Questions for Educational Videos" was published at AIED 2025. 
In this work, we explore if vision language models (VLMs) can be used to automatically generated questions for educational videos. 
We systematically these models, investigate the effects of fine-tuning, and analyze the role of the video modalities. 
Our findings show both the potential and current limitations of these models, pointing to the need for improved datasets and future research to advance question generation for learning contexts.
