      <p>On July 15, 2025, our paper “Enhancing the Learning Experience Using Vision-Language Models to Generate Questions for Educational Videos” was published at AIED 2025. 
In this work, we explore if vision language models (VLMs) can be used to automatically generated questions for educational videos. 
We systematically these models, investigate the effects of fine-tuning, and analyze the role of the video modalities. 
Our findings show both the potential and current limitations of these models, pointing to the need for improved datasets and future research to advance question generation for learning contexts.</p>

      <p>On September 20, 2024, our paper “Question Generation Capabilities of Small Large Language Models” was published at NLDB 2024. 
In this work, we examine how fine-tuned text-based transformers can support automatic question generation for educational purposes. 
We compare different model architectures, analyze the impact of various token search strategies, and introduce a manual evaluation metric to assess naturalness and suitability of generated questions.</p>

<p>Our results highlight how transformer architectures influence the structure and quality of generated questions, while search strategies play only a minor role.</p>
